Unix command-line cheat sheet
===

We are developing this Unix command-line cheat sheet based on our own
experience and that of close friends and students. The main principles
behind this cheat sheet are:

* Minimal look and feel
* Straight to the point
* Expandable items for more details
* Printer friendly.

Feedback will be welcome. Feel free to PR too.
